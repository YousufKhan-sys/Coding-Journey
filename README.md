# 🚀 My Coding Journey

Welcome to my learning space. This repository documents my day-to-day growth as I develop stronger problem-solving abilities, discipline, and technical thinking.

## 🎯 My Goals

### Daily Learning Goals

* Learn something new every day, even if it’s small
* Spend at least 30–60 minutes practicing consistently
* Break complex problems into simpler parts
* Review and improve my previous work regularly

### Skill Development Goals

* Strengthen logical and analytical thinking
* Improve debugging and error-solving skills
* Write cleaner and more organized code over time
* Become more independent in finding solutions

### Mindset Goals

* Stay patient with the learning process
* Embrace mistakes as part of improvement
* Be curious and willing to explore new concepts
* Track progress instead of comparing with others

## 📈 How I Track My Progress

* Daily practice files labeled by date or day number
* Notes on what I learned and what I found challenging
* Reflection on how I can do better tomorrow

This repository is not just about code — it is about building consistency, confidence, and a strong foundation for the future.

*Learning every day. Improving every day.* ✨
